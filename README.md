# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing11

This project contains a single HTML file and uses Playwright for testing.  Since there are no external dependencies, the setup is relatively straightforward.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a new file named `.github/workflows/main.yml` in the root of your repository.  This file will contain your GitHub Actions configuration.

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or the branch you want to trigger on
  pull_request:
    branches: '*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16  # Or the Node version required by Playwright

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install playwright

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        uses: PlaywrightHQ/action-playwright@v1
        with:
          PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG: |
            {
              "projects": [
                  {
                    "name": "chromium",
                    "use": "@playwright/test"
                  }
                ],
              "testDir": "./",
            }

          # Set the browser(s) you want to use for testing.  You can add more here if needed.
          BROWSERS: chromium

          # Add environment variables to the action, e.g., for specific test data
          # EXAMPLE ENV VAR:
          # TEST_DATA: ${{ secrets.TEST_DATA }}
          # NOTE: Add your variables here only if needed!

      - name: Display Results
        run: |
          echo "## Test Results"
          echo "Test Status: ${{ steps.run-playwright.outputs.status }}"

          # Add any further post-processing to display test failures, etc.
```

**2. Required Environment Variables (none in this case, if you don't add any variables!)**


**3. Dependencies to Install:**

```bash
npm install playwright
```

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Playwright):**

*   **Playwright Configuration:** The Playwright configuration is hardcoded directly into the workflow. This single HTML file should work with the specified configuration.   Ensure the tests are in the same directory as the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file if your `PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG` testDir is "./".

*   **Test Files:** If you have multiple test files (e.g., `mytests.spec.js`), modify `testDir` in the `PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG` within the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to point to the appropriate directory.


**5. Viewing Test Results:**

The action will print the test status (passed or failed) and will also have detailed output in the GitHub Actions run.  Check the "Details" tab for failure reasons, steps executed, and any specific error messages in Playwright's output.


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **`npm ERR!` or similar errors:** Check your Node.js installation, npm version, and internet connection.
* **Playwright Errors:** Carefully review the Playwright output for specific error messages, which will often point to the issue (e.g., issues connecting to the browser, element not found).
* **Browser Issues:** Ensure your chosen browsers (chromium, etc.) are properly installed and working on the GitHub Actions runner.


**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps for HTML:**

* **Local Server (for Testing):**
    * Install a local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or a tool like `http-server`).
    * Run the server in the same directory as your HTML file.
    * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the server's specified port).


* **Playwright for Browser Testing:**
    * Install Playwright: Run the `npm install playwright` command in your terminal.
    * Use the Playwright API to interact with the page.


* **HTML Validation:** Use tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) to validate your HTML code for errors.


* **Cross-browser Testing:**
    * Use Playwright with different browser types within the GitHub Actions configuration.
    *  Use the Playwright configuration to run tests on chromium and other browsers that are supported.


**Important Note:** For security reasons, it is strongly suggested NOT to hardcode sensitive data (passwords, API keys) directly in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file or elsewhere in your repository. Instead, use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information and access it securely through environment variables.


This setup provides a starting point.  Adjust the `PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG` and other options as needed for your specific testing requirements. Carefully review the Playwright action and adjust the workflow to suit your exact project. Remember to adapt and add more details based on the actual code and testing needs.
